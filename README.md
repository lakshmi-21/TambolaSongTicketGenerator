# TambolaSongTicketGenerator

The App1.java file has code that is similar to harrysethi/Tambola-Ticket-Generator

This ticket has grid of 3 rows and 9 columns of which 15 cells will be filled for each ticket with songs


generateTickets.java file has all the utility functions

all you have to do is just to give the file paths in line no 25,26,27

the format for songs file excel would be: 1st column will have sl no starting from 1 and 2nd column wll have the songs name

the format for names file excel would be: 1st column will have the names of the participants(here it is email, you can change it if you want), 2nd column will have the number of tickets they want (here in this it is in multiple of 500, so if it is 500 that means 1 ticket)
